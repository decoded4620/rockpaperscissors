First issue:

Already had MongoDB (windows 64) and Mongo DB Ubuntu 14


Step 2. Install Meteor (Win 10)

Running Meteor (dind't work on either my Win10, nor Ubuntu Vritual Machine)

    Same Error;

    This can be caused by MongoDB being unable to write to a local dat
    Check that you have permissions to write to .meteor/local. MongoDB
    not support filesystems like NFS that do not allow file locking.

    meteor reset (on Windows fixed issue). 

    REASON: Can't run meteor on shared folder for hypervisor, due to Mongo's inability to obtain a file lock on the db.

Create meteor app

    meteor rockpaperscissors
    cd rockpaperscissors
    meteor
    
    RESULT: Yay, default page is showing.
    
    
Setup .github repository

    git init
    git commit -m "initial project addition"
